## My process

Approach:
  To ensure the design was clean and responsive across all screen sizes, I used Flexbox for layout and alignment. Flexbox provided an efficient way to center the content both vertically and horizontally, making the card adaptable to various screen sizes without requiring absolute positioning or manual adjustments.

Why Flexbox?
  Flexbox is perfect for this project because:

  It simplifies the process of centering elements on the page.
  It allows dynamic resizing of the card and its content, ensuring responsiveness without complex calculations.
  Itâ€™s intuitive and requires minimal code compared to alternative methods like grid or absolute positioning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
